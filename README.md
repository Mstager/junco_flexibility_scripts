# junco_flexibility_scripts

This repository includes scripts to replicate the analyses in:

**Stager M, Senner NR, Swanson DL, Carling MD, Grieves TJ, and Cheviron ZA. 2020. Temperature heterogeneity correlates with intraspecific variation in physiological flexibility in a small endotherm. bioRxiv.**


Included are:

* junco_insitu.R # *R script for running analyses on in situ data*

* pop_flex.R # *R script for running analyses on acclimated individuals*

* *Commands for processing RAD-Seq data: demultiplexing using STACKS, mapping reads with bwa, variant calling with STACKS, and filtering with vcftools.*

* RDA.R # *R script to run redundancy analysis on population genetic data*



Associated data are available in the supplementary materials:

1. TableS1.csv # *A file containing data for individuals sampled in situ*

2. TableS2.csv # *A file containing data for population genetic samples from across the Junco genus*

3. TableS3.csv # *A file containing data for acclimated individuals*

Raw reads will be available from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SUB8384841).
